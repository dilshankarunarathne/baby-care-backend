## Description

This project will design a camera-based infant monitoring system that alerts caregivers or parents about a baby's resting posture. The baby's resting position is analyzed using computer vision and image processing to detect dangerous or uncomfortable positions. This sensor-free baby monitor is more convenient and affordable for parents.

Baby monitoring ensures baby safety, comfort, and parental piece of mind. Audio and video baby monitors don't alert caregivers to the infant's resting position. The proposed method covers this gap by monitoring the baby's sleeping position with a webcam.

The goal of this project is to create a reliable and simple solution that lets caregivers keep their children safe while sleeping without sensors. This technology helps parents understand their baby's sleep habits with automatic sleeping position identification and notifications.
